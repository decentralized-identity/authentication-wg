# Authentication Working Group

Join this group to contribute to standards and technology that designs and implements authentication protocols that rely upon open standards and cryptographic protocols, including DIDs and DID Documents. This group develops specifications, protocols, and formats for data structures used for authentication. 

The active work items that are underway in the DIF Authentication Working Group

## DID Authentication Profile for SIOP

This specification defines the SIOP DID AuthN flavor to use OpenID Connect (OIDC) together with the strong decentralization, privacy and security guarantees of DID for everyone who wants to have a generic way to integrate SSI wallets into their web applications.

## DID Comms

A shared effort with the HL Aries project to create a standardized means of authenticated general message passing between DID controllers. Currently, DIF provides a DID Comms JavaScript implementation of pack/unpack.
